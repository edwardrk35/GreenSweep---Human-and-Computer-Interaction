# GreenSweep - Human and Computer Interaction
Human and Computer Interaction Project

This repository contains my Human and Computer Interaction subject project, GreenSweep. It is an simple web design project using HTML, CSS, and JS about trash recycling which include a lot of features to interact with, while maintaining the human and computer interaction principles.
